Hey everyone! 
I recently created a Udemy clone using just HTML and CSS to practice my frontend development skills.

A full responsive layout similar to the Udemy homepage

A clean navigation bar with a search field and icons

Course category buttons for filtering content

A banner section to showcase promotions

Multiple course cards with images, titles, ratings, and pricing

A structured footer with learning paths and info columns

 Tech Used:
HTML5

CSS3 (Flexbox)

Google Fonts
